# Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset of wine samples, and the system can evaluate the quality of new wine samples based on learned characteristics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishek4209/End-To-End-Wine-Quality-Prediction-.git
    cd winequalityprediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure project settings in `config/config.yaml` and `params.yaml` as needed.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to start the model training and testing process:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. If there's a web interface, start it by running `app.py`:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the wine data to make it suitable for training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate features that will improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on a test dataset to measure its performance.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web app or API for real-time predictions.

## Research

The `research/trials.ipynb` notebook contains experiments and trials carried out during model development. It serves as a record of exploratory data analysis and model tuning efforts.
